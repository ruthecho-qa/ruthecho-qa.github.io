## 👋 About Me

I turn chaotic release cycles into confident deployments. As a Senior QA Engineer with 7+ years of experience in Agile software testing (including 4+ years working remotely with global teams), I specialize in bridging the gap between development speed and production stability. Whether for large SaaS platforms or early-stage FinTech apps, my goal is the same: transition manual testing processes into scalable, automated solutions that ensure release readiness.

I've seen what happens when QA is treated as an afterthought: unclear requirements, untracked bugs, and unpredictable releases. My approach focuses on turning that chaos into clarity—building structure, visibility, and measurable quality into every sprint.

### 🎯 How I Add Value

**In my full-time role**: I orchestrate Release Integration Testing (RIT) cycles and collaborate with cross-functional teams to identify root causes and optimize delivery pipelines. I focus on risk management and helping teams migrate from legacy tools to modern automation frameworks like Playwright.

**For startups and small teams**: I collaborate with founders who don't yet have dedicated QA. I help define testing workflows from the ground up, write effective test cases, and establish reporting structures that drive better release decisions.
