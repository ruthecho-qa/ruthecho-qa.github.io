                <h3>From Chaos to Clarity</h3>
                <p>I've seen what happens when QA is treated as an afterthought: unclear requirements, untracked bugs, and unpredictable releases. My approach focuses on turning that chaos into clarity—building structure, visibility, and measurable quality into every sprint.</p>
                <p>With 7+ years of experience in software quality assurance, I've tested web and mobile applications across various domains—covering manual testing, test design, regression, and defect management. Currently, I'm expanding my automation skills with Playwright, Maestro, and k6, bringing scalability and efficiency to small, fast-moving teams.</p>

                <div class="value-item">
                    <h4>In My Full-Time Role</h4>
                    <p>I orchestrate Release Integration Testing (RIT) cycles and collaborate with cross-functional teams to identify root causes and optimize delivery pipelines. I focus on risk management and helping teams migrate from legacy tools to modern automation frameworks like Playwright.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-item">
                    <h4>For Startups and Small Teams</h4>
                    <p>I collaborate with founders who don't yet have dedicated QA. I help define testing workflows from the ground up, write effective test cases, and establish reporting structures that drive better release decisions. My focus is on building your QA foundation so you can scale with confidence.</p>
