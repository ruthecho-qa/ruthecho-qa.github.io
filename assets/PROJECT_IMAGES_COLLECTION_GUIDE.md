## 🎨 Alternative: Use Placeholder Service

If you can't get actual screenshots immediately, you can use these placeholder services temporarily:

**Option 1 - Via Website**:
Visit https://placehold.co/1200x600/4A4AF5/white and download placeholders

**Option 2 - Edit HTML temporarily** (I can help with this)

**Option 3 - Create simple mockups** in Canva with app names and icons

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Priority order**: Get DOOgether, KYZN, and Hijra Taaruf first (from app stores - easiest)
2. **For Vyond**: Consider using your work dashboard (if allowed by company policy)
3. **For PARSEL & KlikBCA**: Generic SAP/banking interfaces work well if actual screenshots aren't available
4. **Privacy first**: Always blur sensitive data (account numbers, real user info, transaction amounts)
5. **Ask clients**: If unsure, reach out to previous clients for marketing materials
